# Production Problem 5: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment.

You only need to sketch your redesign, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/
* Android Design Guidelines:
  http://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):
https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/bottom-sheets.html#bottom-sheets-modal-bottom-sheets
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
I implemented my sketch where is mobile friend for the user thumb taking the concept from the mobile web design book. I rearrange the boxes below the login query into a drop menu when the user tap on it on the mobile view. I have a simple setup of login and password of iit with login and forgot password. Since clear is not needed. The website is simple and gets to the point of login. IIT alert is on the bottom of the menu. 

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):
https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-schemes
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
"The guidline on picking a primary color help me choose two focus color. I choose the Primary color indgo blue or relatively close to blue as it provides the header without distracting the user. The black portion is for the menu to have a good contrast on the  user eye. Upon choosing the color I implemented a + to hide the menu from the initial start of going iit. The idea was inspired from looking samples of the color choices where I saw + hiding the menu. Since the main focus of the iit web page is have the student login, the + will the additional information that can be accessed later by the user if needed."
