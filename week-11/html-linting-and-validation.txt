# Production Problem 6: HTML De-Linting and Validation

## The Problem

Using the HTML Tidy tool, installed as a command-line tool on your computer via instructions at http://www.html-tidy.org, and the HTML validator at http://validator.w3.org, rework the HTML file in this directory (`index.html`) so that is free from errors.

## Resources

* HTML Tidy: http://www.html-tidy.org/
* HTML Validator: http://validator.w3.org/

## Deliverables

1. First, run HTML Tidy on the index.html file. Copy and paste the errors here:

etango@etango-VirtualBox:~/Desktop/itmd362-pp/week-11$ tidy index.html 
line 6 column 5 - Warning: <meta> unexpected or duplicate quote mark
line 9 column 5 - Error: <figure> is not recognized!
line 9 column 5 - Warning: discarding unexpected <figure>
line 10 column 46 - Warning: <img> attribute with missing trailing quote mark
line 13 column 14 - Warning: replacing invalid character code 128
line 13 column 15 - Warning: replacing invalid character code 153
line 14 column 5 - Warning: discarding unexpected </figure>
line 10 column 7 - Warning: missing </a> before <p>
line 5 column 5 - Warning: <meta> proprietary attribute "charset"
line 5 column 5 - Warning: <meta> lacks "content" attribute
line 7 column 5 - Warning: <link> inserting "type" attribute
line 16 column 5 - Warning: <script> inserting "type" attribute
Info: Document content looks like HTML Proprietary
11 warnings, 1 error were found!


2. Fix as many errors as are listed by HTML Tidy, and re-run until there are no errors reported. HINT: Always fix the first error reported, then re-run tidy. Then, run the contents of `index.html` through the HTML validator. List any errors that the validator reports here:
    Error: No space between attributes.

3. Finally, fix the errors that are listed by the HTML validator, and commit the `index.html` file in its error-free state.
	done

4. Bonus: What error remained that neither Tidy nor the validator did not catch? Fix it, if you've not already, and mark as its own commit.
The head tag of the html was not close. It was not caught by either of the tidy and validator.
