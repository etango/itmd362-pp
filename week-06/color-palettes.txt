Explanation of your color choices:
The reason why I picked the shades of blue, because the community of the gaming industries favors the color blue. Majoritying of the products feature a blue led scheme. Mechanical Keyboard features blue led, razer mouse such as death adder, mazer, logitech and etc. Espescially many of the pro team has theme of blue in them. 
Example CLG is black and blue and Cloud 9 is white and blue. This all made a wonderful contrast and would attract customers. Also haveing the custom-gaming laptop 
color focus a metallic silver or shades of grey with blue led keyboard is a very eye appealing compare a backlit standard white light. This definitely attracts more
customer that are into the game industries. 

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Explanation of your color choices: The reason I chose shade of green because it represent the theme of organic food which is natural and healthy. There is no better color
to present the natural other than green. If you go into a field of forest is different shade of green depending on the plant. Also green veggie is healthy for us. The dark shade of green 
is awesome for the text and the website it self can focus different shades of green around the area such as submit button or nav. 

* A complementary palette for a banking website.
