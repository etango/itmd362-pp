Explanation of your color choices:
The reason why I picked the shades of blue, because the community of the gaming industries favors the color blue. Majoritying of the products feature a blue led scheme. Mechanical Keyboard features blue led, razer mouse such as death adder, mazer, logitech and etc. Espescially many of the pro team has theme of blue in them. 
Example CLG is black and blue and Cloud 9 is white and blue. This all made a wonderful contrast and would attract customers. Also haveing the custom-gaming laptop 
color focus a metallic silver or shades of grey with blue led keyboard is a very eye appealing compare a backlit standard white light. This definitely attracts more
customer that are into the game industries.
