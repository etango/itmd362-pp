            <p>Welcome to our organization! The goal of the corporation is focusing on developing a software that allows us to operate complex machinery. The corporation is looking for fresh software developers with open minds and the desire to learn more about software development. We are working with another company that is developing a Mobile Suit that requires software that handles the user interface and allows the pilot to move the machine with ease. Keep in mind, since the machine is going to be a complex machine, the task at hand will be challenging, but we are a team that will support each other and overcome any obstacles that occur.  </p>
