## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-13/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Behavioral: Drives aggressive at high rpm, great handling on corners, and a satisfying exhaust sound from stock piles. 

* Reflective: The mazda 6 style reflect a low profile sport style while keeping it simple. 

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1. Elegant
2. Solid color contrast with the silver trimp
3. Speedy
